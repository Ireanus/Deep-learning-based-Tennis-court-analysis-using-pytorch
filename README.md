# **Deep-Learning-Based Tennis Court Analysis Using PyTorch**

## **Introduction**
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze a tennis match video, measuring the movement and speed of players, the tennis ball, and the number of shots taken. The system employs YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to extract court keypoints, enabling the calculation of player and ball positions relative to the tennis court.

## **Aim**
The primary aim of this project is to provide insights on how computer vision methodologies designed for tennis analysis to can be adapted into geosciences. This includes automating geological data processing, improving the accuracy of natural resource exploration, and tackling other environmental and geoscientific challenges efficiently.

## **Possible Use Cases in Geosciences**
The tools and techniques in this project—YOLO for object detection and CNNs for keypoint extraction—can be applied in to solve environental and geoscience problems such as:

1. **Mineral Exploration:** Identifying mineral deposits in field images or drone footage.
2. **Structural Mapping:** Mapping landforms, joints, or fracture networks in rock outcrops.
3. **Topographical Analysis:** Delineating topographical features and boundaries for geological studies.
4. **Seismic Analysis:** Analyzing seismic wave propagation patterns.
5. **Sediment Transport Tracking:** Monitoring the movement of sediments in rivers and coastal areas.
6. **Hazard Detection:** Detecting landslides, monitoring flood zones, and tracking volcanic ash clouds to provide early warnings.
7. **Mining Safety:** Real-time monitoring of mining operations to enhance safety and operational efficiency.
